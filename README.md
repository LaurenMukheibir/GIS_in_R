# GIS_in_R
Looking at the Shyshark distribution across the Cape Peninsula. Data from iNaturalist were used on three species of Shysharks (Haploblepharus edwardsii, Haploblepharus pictus and Poroderma africanum).
This assignment is for Jasper Slingsby, learning how to create interactive maps using GIS. 
In this GitHub Repository you will find a folder named scripts where all my analyses are. There is an R-script as well as an R-Markdown. I used the R-Script to iron out the kinks in my code.
In the Scripts folder, you will find an HTML file, which also shows on the main page. 
The rsom cache folder shows some maps that were created using the 'cartolight' function.
